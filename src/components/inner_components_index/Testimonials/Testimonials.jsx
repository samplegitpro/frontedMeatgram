            <p>
              Excellent service and very humble and gentle executive staff
              mutton quality is good and fresh. Once the order was not good as
              expected I informed them the issue. They immediately re-delivered
              same order complimentary. I like this This thing.

            <p>
              The quality of all meats which we have purchased, especially
              freshwater fishes have been great. The delivery experience has
              been good as well with respect to time to delivery.
